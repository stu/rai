RAI Technical Manual


SwitchPlayer
- Causes an 'enter' event to be called on the room the active player is in.
  Best thing to do is not to have any print statements in your enter event.

  If you use light and darkness in your game, be sure your enter event correctly
  sets the light flag for that room.

Look
- Does not override the darkness flag. If a light source is in the room, calls the room 'look' event,
otherwise calls the 'in_dark' routine.

Load
- When a game is loaded (either from disk or ram), an internal 'look' command is issued, that does not
cost a move.
